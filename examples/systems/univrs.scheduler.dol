exegesis {
  The univrs.scheduler system implements intelligent workload distribution and resource
  allocation across the cluster infrastructure. It maintains a priority queue to manage
  pending container deployment requests and applies configurable scheduling policies to
  determine optimal placement based on resource availability, affinity rules, and capacity
  constraints. Every container that enters the system must be scheduled according to these
  policies, ensuring consistent and predictable behavior across the platform. The scheduler
  emits detailed events for each scheduling decision, enabling real-time monitoring of
  placement activities and integration with observability systems. By depending on both
  container lifecycle management and node discovery, the scheduler maintains an accurate
  understanding of cluster state and available capacity for making informed placement decisions.
