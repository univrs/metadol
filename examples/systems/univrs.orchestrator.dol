exegesis {
  The univrs.orchestrator system serves as the central coordination layer for distributed
  container management across the univrs platform. It ensures that all operational activities
  are properly authenticated before execution, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive
  system resources. Every significant event within the orchestrator is captured and logged,
  providing a complete audit trail for debugging, compliance, and system analysis. Error
  handling is comprehensive, with all failures being reported to the appropriate monitoring
  and alerting systems to enable rapid response. This system depends on both container
  lifecycle management and node discovery capabilities to maintain a coherent view of the
  distributed infrastructure and orchestrate workloads effectively across available resources.
